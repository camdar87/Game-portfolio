# 01: AI Strategy advanced assessment tasks

- Make tic tac toe! Start a brand new project and implement a tic tac toe with an AI player - how you do the game interface is up to you - it can be graphical, or text-based, etc...
- Basic functionality would be: 
  - The player can click on a square (or somehow specify where they want to 'move') - place an 'X' in that square.
  - The AI should work its way down a MinMax tree and determine the best square for its move (level 3-4 should be more than enough).
  - Repeat until someone (likely the AI!) wins the game (or draws)...
