# 01: Game mechanics Advanced Assessment Tasks

## Extra features

Implement this advanced functionality. These tasks are self-directed and will require some independent research and problem-solving.

- Implement **Enemy 2** - there is a sprite for a second enemy in the game assets - implement this enemy with increased stats (health, movement speed, etc) and add it to the later waves.
- Your final Waves (last 2 or 3) should feature **a mix** of the 2 Enemy types - you will need to adjust your **SpawnEnemy** script to accept 2 enemy prefabs, and adjust your code to spawn differnt amounts of both.
- You could achieve this by duplicating all the relevant variables for the second enemy, but you should implement this in **as robust (and elegant) way as possible**, in case in the future you want to add even more enemy types (Hint: use Lists where possible)
